# App Actions Fitness BII sample

## Description 
This is a sample Fitness application that allows displaying workout information as well as starting
and stopping a workout. By implementing [App Actions](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-actions/overview),
we allow the user to call upon our application to fulfill supported
[built-in intents (BIIs)](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents) in the
fitness category.


This sample supports the following BIIs:
* `actions.intent.START_EXERCISE`: Open the app and start an exercise session.
* `actions.intent.STOP_EXERCISE`: Open the app and stops the current exercise session.


This sample uses [Andriod Intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters) for fulfillment 

_Note_: This sample application is a fork of the [Android to-do sample](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples).
